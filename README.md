# Ghost-Archives
A jQuery plugin that brings post archive functionality to Ghost by using the new public Ghost API.

A front-end solution as Ghost does not currently support proper "archives" on the server side. This utilizes the new public Ghost API which is available as of Ghost 0.7.2, it must be enabled via the dashboard under the Labs tab as of writing this.
